              Ant Financial has a large number of enterprise-level products.
              With complex scenarios, designers and developers often need to
              respond fast due to frequent changes in product demands and
              concurrent R and D workflow. Many similar contents exist in the
              process. Through abstraction, we could obtain some stable and
              highly reusable components and pages.

              On the other hand, with the trend of commercialization, more and
              more enterprise products begin to pursue better user experiences.
              Under this situation, Ant User-Experience Design Team builds a
              design system for enterprise products based on four design values
              of Natural, Certain, Meaningful, and Growing. It aims to uniform
              the user interface specs and reduce redundancies and excessive
              production costs, helping product designers to focus on better
              user experience.
